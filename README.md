Simple Notepad Application 
Uses QT and C++

Personal Project to create a notepad app with shortcuts and visuals that i like for daily usage since windows' notepad is -_-


Planned Features:
* Tabbed System to open multiple files
* ~~ Checking for unsaved text while quitting and indicator for context being not saved ~~ Done 
* Vim like shortcuts etc, maybe view edit modes
* ~~ Hide menubar when not needed ~~ Ctrl + M	
* Show name of the file in the title and path of the file in the status bar
* Add char counter to status bar
* ~~  Add a button to share the current txt to share through a website like ctxt.io ~~  Done, uploaded to Filebin
