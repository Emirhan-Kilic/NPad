Simple Notepad Application 
Uses QT and C++

Personal Project to create a notepad app with shortcuts and visuals that I like for daily usage since Windows' notepad is -_-


Planned Features:
* Tabbed System to open multiple files -- Cancelled
* ~~Checking for unsaved text while quitting and indicator for the context being not saved~~ Done
* ~~Using "**" to add bullet points~~ Done 
* Maybe view edit modes 
* ~~Hide menubar when not needed~~ Ctrl + M	
* ~~Show the file's name in the title and the file's path in the status bar~~ Fixed title for the file name; status bar useless except in exceptional cases.
* ~~Add char counter to the status bar~~  Done
* ~~Add a button to share the current text to share through a website like ctxt.io~~  Done, uploaded to Filebin
