Simple Notepad Application 
Uses QT and C++

Personal Project to create a notepad app with shortcuts and visuals that I like for daily usage since Windows' notepad is -_-


Planned Features:
* Tabbed System to open multiple files -- Cancelled
* ~~Checking for unsaved text while quitting and indicator for the context being not saved~~ Done
* ~~Using "**" to add bullet points~~ Done 
* ~~Maybe view edit modes~~ Done
* ~~Hide menubar when not needed~~ Ctrl + M	
* ~~Show the file's name in the title and the file's path in the status bar~~ Fixed title for the file name; status bar useless except in exceptional cases.
* ~~Add char counter to the status bar~~  Done
* ~~Add a button to share the current text to share through a website like ctxt.io~~  Done, uploaded to Filebin

Ctrl Q: Exit

Ctrl M: Hide Menu and status bar

Ctrl S: Save the file; if not already saved, it becomes "save as."

Ctrl N: New File, warning is shown if the current file is not saved

Ctrl O: Open File; warning is shown if the current file is not saved

Ctrl P: Cycle Between Edit and View Modes

If the first two characters of any line are:
  
  "**" -> creates a bullet list
  
  "--" -> creates required header for labs and hws in bilkent.
